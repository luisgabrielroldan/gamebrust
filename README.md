# GameBRust

This is a Gameboy Emulator toy project.

I was curious about to learn rust and decided to start with something that also has my interest: the console emulators.

So this is a small project that I used to understand the concepts related to the emulatation and also gain some basic understanding of Rust.

It passes the Blargg's Gameboy tests for CPU instructions.
