# GameBRust

This is a Gameboy Emulator toy project.

I was curious about learning Rust and decided to start with something that also has my interest: the console emulators.

So this is a small project that I made to understand the concepts related to the emulation and also gain some basic understanding of Rust.

BTW: It doesn't implement any Save feature! (yet)
